 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.

 *
 * If you want to use multiple Sass files, you should generally use the Sass @import rule instead
 * of these Sprockets directives. Using Sprockets directives all Sass files exist within their own
 * scope, making variables or mixins only available within the document they were defined in.
